Hi my name is Kaushik Dontula. This is my README.txt file for program two of OS1. 

1. Use cd and ls to navigate your way into the correct directory in the terminal. 
2. To compile the file enter "gcc -std=c99 smallsh.c -o smallsh" into the terminal and press enter. 
3. Now to run the executible called "smallsh" enter the command "./smallsh.
4. Once you hit enter on that command, the program will start running, you can follow the prompts to navigate through the program.
